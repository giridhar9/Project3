Instagrid created as the third project for the Web Development program at RED Academy in Vancouver.

This project was to develop a one-page, responsive website that allows a user to search for a hashtag via the Instagram API. This website uses Ajax to fetch data from an Instagram API endpoint and transitions users between UI states, starting where no photos have been returned, and then subsequently transitioning where photos populate the grid. The site can be viewed online at the following URL: https://giridhar9.github.io/Project3
